# SAR Team Manager

Since 2015 I'm member of OSP Gdansk :fire_engine: (Ochotnicza Straz Pozarna / Volunteer Fire Department). Our specialization is 
search for missing persons using trained and certified dogs :service_dog: . Each formalized group struggles with the same issues - 
a lot of members, numerous deadlines, plenty of data that you need to store somewhere, not to mention how to manage
all those things together.

Why not to create some tool, which could manage everything in one place?

Main goal of this project is to create all-in-one tool, that would help to manage small organizations.

**:exclamation::exclamation: Project is in progress :exclamation::exclamation:**
